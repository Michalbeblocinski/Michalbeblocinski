**'Web Developer'**

I am a computer science student who liked
programming a few years ago. At the beginning
I was learning functional languages. In this year
I began my specialization in web programming.
To this day I have already made some fullstack
applications. I also gained first commercial
experience with some freelance projects. Right
now I am focused on learning React.js. I am
looking for a job to gain experience and become
a fullstack web developer.
